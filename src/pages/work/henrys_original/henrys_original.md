Henry's Original is an up-and-coming cannabis product company.

When we first began talking, we focused the conversation on reaching their next business goals. I started by mocking the website around their vision of the product in the coming months. From there, I helped them implement a beautiful website that quickly tells their customer who Henry's the brand is, what they stand for, what their product offerings were, and where they could purchase the products!

My responsibilities:

- Design
- Development, custom JavaScript and CSS
- Planning
- Optimizing their SEO and auditing their analytics. Within a week of improving the content and website SEO, Henry's improved from 8th to 4th in Google PageRank.
- Educating the team how to modify their own website
