Artifact Nursery is a boutique wholesale nursery for high-quality, organic cannabis plants.

When they approached me, their website could use a lot of work. The content was outdated, the UX was poor, users couldn't find the correct information and it was affecting sales. For a cannabis company in an emerging market, it was a _must_ to look legitimate.

When I first spoke to Jamie, founder of Artifact Nursery, we talked in depth about their goals. From there, we began to strategize how we could build and design their web presence to help their users learn what Artifact was, where they could find the storefront, and their major product offerings.

Together, we collaborated on design and development to rebuild their website using Squarespace. To really capture their brand, I wrote custom JavaScript and CSS. We also focused on optimizing SEO and auditing analytics. Finally, it was critical to me that the team knew how to modify their own website so that they could change it as the business grew.

Our Results:

- Improving the brand and web presence.
- Increasing sales from up-to-date information and improved content.
- Significantly improving search rankings.
