excerpt: "Designing and building the business web presence for an official DJ for Macy's, Urban Decay, Dior."
---

Richard (AKA DJ RichEBeats) is a Southern California DJ with impressive clientsâ€“Macy's, Urban Decay, Dior. With a few of the world's largest global brands as his clientele, it was a no-brainer that his web presence needed to capture his raw personality.

In addition, it needed to command legitimacy and make him even more discoverable. I also took note that he was primarily active on Instagram.

When Richard and I first began talking, I saw building a web presence as an opportunity to help expand his client list. After a few long conversations, I prototyped a design that focused on his style and allowed clients to quickly contact him. It included a gallery that showed him at work, and his Instagram feed to show off his personality and to increase his followership.

Together, we're continually evolving the design to capture his personality and improve the SEO ranking. I used cutting-edge, but proven technologies to allow me to make lightning fast changes, but also future-proof the site.
