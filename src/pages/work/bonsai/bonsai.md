Bonsai is a YCombinator company aimed to be the freelancer business toolkit with contracts, invoices, accounting, and more.

Only a half year out of YCombinabot, I began working on contract to help with the growing demands of the frontend for Bonsai.

As it became clear that the team needed more than frontend help, I remained on contract but worked full-time as a full stack developer - implementing entire features using Ruby on Rails, jQuery, and React-Redux.

It's been the ultimate pleasure to help build tools that I love to use myself.
