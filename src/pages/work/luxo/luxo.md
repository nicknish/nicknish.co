Luxo is an LA-based music producer. Launching his site, I consulted on growth, brand, and content strategies as he unrolls his revival of the house music scene in Los Angeles. Quick view of my value adds:

- Launched Squarespace website
- Setup Google Analytics and audited SEO
- Added custom CSS and JavaScript for UI design

- Email campaigns via MailChimp:

  - Designed emails and email capture
  - Automated welcome emails
  - Connected analytics to track performance

- Consulted and implemented growth strategies, including:

  - Make it extremely easy to download and share tracks for free
  - Rethinking Twitter, Facebook, Soundcloud, and Instagram content strategy.

- Asset creation, including logo for website/press/email/etc.
