Sam Joson is an up-and-coming freelance writer/copywriter based in Los Angeles, CA.

Doing brilliant work for respected establishments like the California Science Foundation, and emerging brands like iHeartRaves, Better Brave, and Tidal magazine she had these considerations:

1.  **Capture her personality while also looking professional**.
1.  Highlight her writing.
1.  Highlight her growing portfolio.

Coming from WordPress.com, she was frustrated at the inflexibility of the platform. She wanted a place that allowed her to write, but would be flexible enough to grow with her.

It was important to me that I chose a blend of platforms and tech that allowed her to grow, but would be flexible to future changes. I wanted to create a self-serve platform for her that minimized complexity for her so she focus on her writing.

Together, we collaborated to create a fun, professional cat-themed site that put her writing and portfolio first. We used cutting-edge technologies that were still proven to ensure her site would be future-proof, but would also minimize risk and allow for any changes she might want to make.
