Credit Karma's mission is to help create financial progress for everyone.

As a long-time user, I am excited to be working for Credit Karma. Part of my life's mission is to help create more opportunity for others, especially those who didn't have the mentorship and support system that I was lucky to have.

At CK, I'm a software engineer in the Autos division, where we help create insights about how to handle one's automobile-related finances.
