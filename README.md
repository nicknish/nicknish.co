# Portfolio V2

This portfolio version is built with GatsbyJS, a static site generator. In this project, we use the JAMStack architecture using React, GraphQL, and Markdown files.

To get reacquainted, check out the `package.json` first or use one of these commands:

```bash
yarn develop # start server for dev with Hot Module Reloading (!)
yarn build # create production build
yarn serve # start server for testing build site
```
